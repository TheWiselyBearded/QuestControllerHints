As a developer, simply add **ButtonController** scripts to specify different button configurations. 
* To configure hints, create your own script or use the **TutorialExample** in the inspector to specify the controls.

* The **HintManager** is responsible for activating hint instances and calculating the state of the tutorial based on the ordered list provided by the user.
* The **TutorialExample** script shows how we can setup an inspector component to allow us to coordinate a sequence of tips. If we want to activate tutorial mode, simply toggle the checkbox.

# How it works:

#### *HintManager.cs*
---
This script is assigned is configured using the Left/Right Quest Controller prefab. 
Basically, every single button utilizes the **ButtonController** script to fire _click/press_ events to progress the tutorial mode.
The script is documented and provides the developer with extensibility. Simply define a Button Press/Hold event and assign one of the HintManager methods in the Unity inspector.
